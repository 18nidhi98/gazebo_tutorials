# Importing 2D models

Now that we've made a basic robot, we may want to pimp our ride. Sometimes
 it's easier to design part of a model in a program like Inkscape or
 Illustrator. This tutorial will show you how to make a custom wheel as an
 .svg in Inkscape, import it into Gazebo, and attach it to our robot.

In this tutorial, we are going to use an SVG editor to create the outlines
of the wheel. Then, if the outlines are closed and do not cross each other,
we will create a triangulation of the top side of the wheel, and extrude it
verically to create a 3D mesh.

## Using an SVG editor to draw a wheel

There are many SVG editors. For this tutorial, we will use the Open Source
 Inkscape program (see
[installation instructions](https://inkscape.org/en/download) ).




==================================
=================================

give info on downloading Inkscape
draw custom wheel, with suggestion dimensions (use M2 MOOC content)
show how to save properly
insert into Gazebo; explain each parameter
delete old wheels from robot and attach new ones
use align and snap tools again
save and place in scene
