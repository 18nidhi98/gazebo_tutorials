# Model Editor

Now we'll get to constructing our simple robot. We'll make a wheeled vehicle and add a sensor that will later allow us to make the robot follow a blob/person. 

To construct the robot,  we'll use the Model Editor which lets us construct simple models right in the GUI. For more complex models, you'll need to learn how to write .XML files [link to tutorial]. 
But for now, we can do everything in the Gazebo GUI!


### Model Editor user interface

(include limitations of ME, show examples of models made with ME)

### Vehicle construction

(give exact dimensions where possible, use align and snap tools)

### Adding a plugin

(add a blob tracker to the front; explain that plugins are usually more complex and require code; link to Plugins "Topic of Interest")

### Save your model
