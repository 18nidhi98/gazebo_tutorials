# Recap

Our Velodyne sensor is fully functional, but we don't have any hooks to
a robot middleware, like ROS. One of the benefits of using Gazebo with ROS
is that it's easy to switch between the real-world and the simulated. In
order to make this happen, we need to have our sensor play nicely with the
ROS ecosystem.

# Create a ROS plugin

# Conclusion

Congratulations, you now have the tools to build custom models, share your
models, and generate a public API. Have fun, and happy simulating!
