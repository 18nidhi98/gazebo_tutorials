# Tutorial: Instrument HDF5 datasets

# Introduction

Instrument tools are provided to dump physical data into HDF5 format. The datasets, together with the [Benchmark Problems for Multibody Dynamis (BPMD)](https://grasp.robotics.cs.rpi.edu/bpmd/) framework are used to unbiasly compare the different methods in solving multibdoy system with bilateral joints and unilateral frictional contacts. These datasets will hep analyzing and constructing new, better and faster solvers, concentrating on algorithms instead of the whole physics engine.

# Example Usage
 

## Collect Datasets
### Use only gzserver
 
### Use the world file
 
 

## View the HDF5 file
 
A hierarchical file shows up:
